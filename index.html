              Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest planet to the sun. It is named after
              the
              Roman
              messenger god, Mercury. Mercury's surface is heavily cratered and has many cliffs and escarpments,
              indicating
              that
              it has experienced significant geological activity in the past. It has a thin atmosphere that is
              constantly
              blasted away by the solar wind, leaving the planet's surface exposed to the harsh space environment.
              <br><br>
              Despite its proximity to the sun, temperatures on Mercury can be extremely cold due to its lack of
              atmosphere
              to
              trap heat.
              <br><br>
              The planet has been visited by only two spacecraft, Mariner 10 in 1974-75 and MESSENGER from 2011-15. The
              data
              returned from these missions has greatly increased our understanding of this fascinating planet.
